# HCIFacebook
HCI Facebook

Reupload for public version with sensitive data removed

To Run: Streamlit run Streamlit.py

or loader on its own: python Loader.py

I don't know if HTMLParser is the best way to get the data out, probably faster with just regex

Loader.py: Turns facebook files into panda data frames

Streamlit.py: Turns panda frames into graphs and puts it in browser

Facebook_info_stripped: File containing facebook files that have been stripped/filled with dummy data, Probably best to use your own data while testing and not upload it to this repo
